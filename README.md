Introduction
  The  project focus on building a fraud prevention system for PayPal. The project utilizes Kafka, Cassandra, Spark, and Spark Streaming, along with a microservices architecture.

  Kafka enables real-time data ingestion and event streaming, facilitating seamless data flow within the system. Cassandra provides scalable storage for  data. Spark is used for offline data analytics and batch processing, while Spark Streaming enables real-time processing of streaming data.

  The microservices architecture promotes modularity and scalability, allowing independent development and deployment of services. The goal is to prevent at least 90% of malicious users using synthetic data.

  By leveraging these technologies and architectural patterns, the project aims to develop a robust and scalable fraud prevention system for PayPal, ensuring real-time risk estimation during transaction processing.


Goal
  The goal of the project for PayPal is to develop a system based on the Lambda architecture that focuses on preventing fraudulent activities by identifying and mitigating risks associated with malicious users. The specific objectives of the project are as follows:

  1.Fraud Prevention: The primary objective is to enhance fraud prevention capabilities within PayPal's system. By leveraging real-time data processing and predictive models, the system aims to identify and flag transactions initiated by malicious users or those with a high risk of being fraudulent.

  2.Risk Estimation: The system will utilize synthetic data, which simulates various fraudulent scenarios and patterns, to train the predictive models. This synthetic data will provide a diverse range of examples for the models to learn from, enabling them to effectively estimate the risk associated with each transaction.

  3.High Detection Rate: The project's goal is to achieve a high detection rate of at least 90% for identifying and preventing malicious users. This means that the system should be able to accurately flag the majority of fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives to ensure a seamless user experience for legitimate users.

  4.Real-time Processing: By adopting the Lambda architecture, the system will process incoming transaction data in real-time. This enables timely detection and prevention of fraudulent activities, reducing the potential impact on PayPal and its users.
